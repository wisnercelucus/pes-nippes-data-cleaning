The environment was created with "conda". To launch it, create a new env "conda create --name env".

Once the env is created activate it: conda activate env
And run: conda install --file requirements.txt

In that we use jupyter-lab not the classic jupyter-notebook. So call: "jupyter-lab"
and start coding!


Sole issue with new anaconda and conda 4.x installed:

1) happen when creating a new venv with conda create -name <name>
CondaHTTPError: HTTP 000 CONNECTION FAILED for url <https://repo.anaconda.com/pkgs/main/win-64/repodata.json>
#10378

Install the latest available binaries from the first recommendation (https://slproweb.com/products/Win32OpenSSL.html) on the OpenSSL wiki page (https://wiki.openssl.org/index.php/Binaries).

2) install reuqirements with conda from a file: conda install --file <requirements.txt> (remove <...>)

possible error: can't find packages from current channels:
please use: conda config --append channels conda-forge

and then re-run the installation command: it should work.
